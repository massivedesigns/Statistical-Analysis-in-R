# Statistical-Analysis-in-R
This project presents a statistical study on the Survival from Malignant Melanoma dataset, which was adapted from (Andersen et al., 1993), using the R programming language (R, 2020). Seven characteristics from patients with malignant melanoma are included in the dataset; these factors shed light on the melanoma prevalence that is being studied. Time is the amount of days a patient lived after the procedure; status is the number of days a patient is alive or has died from melanoma or other unrelated reasons; sex or gender is the patient's gender; and age is the patient's age at the time of surgery. The variables "year," "thickness," and "ulceration" indicate the tumor's millimetre thickness and whether or not it has an ulcer. The process also involved the use of summary statistics, graphical summaries, regression analysis, hypothesis testing, and coefficient computation.
